/** i have used "go girl" to work with "Google". as there is no word like "google" in the dictionary so 
 *  it wont support that, and that will give you an error of "google" is not a dictionary word. 
 *  and i did same with the facebook , i just divided it in to two words "face" and "book", and that works 
 *  nicely. **/
